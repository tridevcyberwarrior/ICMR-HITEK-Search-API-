# ICMR-HITEK-Search-API- 🔍 ICMR + HITEK Search API

A high‑performance search API for 2.5 billion Indian citizen records (ICMR + HITEK data) – featuring phone, Aadhaar, and multi‑field search. Built with FastAPI + Gradio + DuckDB, with remote Parquet indexes hosted on HuggingFace.

📌 Features

· 🔎 Instant search – phone, Aadhaar, name, father’s name, address, district, state, pincode, town, source. · ⚡ 2.5 billion records – indexed and queryable via DuckDB over HTTP/Parquet. · 🎯 Exact & contains modes – flexible searching. · 📱 Gradio UI – user‑friendly web interface for non‑technical users. · 🧩 RESTful API – FastAPI with Swagger docs (/docs). · 🚀 Dedup & connection – deduplicates results and shows connected numbers (phone, other, Aadhaar). · 🕒 Auto‑pinger – built‑in background task to keep the app awake (though external uptime monitor is recommended for free hosting tiers). · 👨‍💻 Developer credit – prominently displayed.

🧰 Tech Stack

· Python 3.9+ · FastAPI – REST API framework · Gradio – UI interface · DuckDB – in‑process analytical database with Parquet and HTTPFS support · HuggingFace – remote storage for partitioned Parquet indexes · Uvicorn – ASGI server · httpx – async HTTP client for pinger

🚀 Quick Start (Local)

    Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/cyber-punk-h/Icmr-and-hitek.git
cd Icmr-and-hitek

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

    Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the application

uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

The app will be available at http://localhost:8000 – Gradio UI at / and API at /docs.

🌍 Deploy on Render (Free/Paid)

    Push code to GitHub – ensure main.py, requirements.txt, and this README are in the root.
    On Render.com, create a New Web Service and connect your repo.
    Fill in: · Name: icmr-search (or your choice) · Environment: Python 3 · Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt · Start Command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
    (Optional) Set environment variables under Advanced: · ICMR_INDEX_SOURCE – remote (default) · ICMR_PARALLEL – 2 (threads for DuckDB) · ICMR_THREADS_PER_CONN – 2 · PORT – Render sets this automatically, don’t override.
    Click Create Web Service.

Your app will be live at https://yourapp.onrender.com within a few minutes.

📡 API Endpoints

Endpoint Method Description / GET Root – app metadata, record count, indexes, developer credit. /health GET Health check – returns status: ok and index readiness. /search GET Primary search endpoint. /search/parallel POST Batch search – up to 50 queries in one request. /docs GET Swagger UI interactive documentation.

🔍 Search Examples

    Unified search (auto‑detects phone / Aadhaar)

GET /search?q=9876543210&limit=10

    Search by specific field

GET /search?field=phoneNumber&q=9876543210
GET /search?field=aadharNumber&q=123456789012
GET /search?field=name&q=Rahul&mode=contains

    Use mobile alias (same as q)

GET /search?mobile=9876543210

    Batch search (POST)

POST /search/parallel
{
  "queries": [
    {"field": "phoneNumber", "value": "9876543210", "limit": 5},
    {"field": "aadharNumber", "value": "123456789012"}
  ],
  "limit": 10
}

Response format

All search endpoints return JSON with:

· query / number – searched term · count – number of results · results – array of records, each with: · All original fields (name, fathersName, phoneNumber, aadharNumber, otherNumber, address, district, pincode, state, town, source) · connected_numbers – list of phone/other/Aadhaar numbers linked to this record.

🧠 How It Works

· The app does not store the full raw database locally. · It uses remote Parquet indexes hosted on HuggingFace, partitioned into 7 files for phone and 7 for Aadhaar. · DuckDB reads these indexes directly over HTTP (via httpfs extension) and executes queries efficiently. · Search is exact match on indexed fields; contains mode is available for name (but not for other fields in remote mode). · Duplicate records are limited to 2 per person (configurable via DUPLICATE_CAP) to avoid overwhelming results.

⏰ Keeping the App Alive (Free Tier)

Render’s free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity. While the app has an internal pinger that pings /health every 2 minutes, this is internal and does not prevent sleep because sleep is based on external traffic.

➡️ To keep your instance awake, set up an external uptime monitor (like UptimeRobot or cron-job.org) that hits your public /health endpoint every 5 minutes.

🛠 Environment Variables

Variable Default Description ICMR_HF_INDEX_BASE https://huggingface.co/datasets/Kzr0xx/icrm-hitek-full-db-mixed/resolve/main Base URL for remote Parquet indexes. ICMR_INDEX_SOURCE remote (Future use) – currently only remote is supported. ICMR_PARALLEL 2 Number of parallel workers for search requests. ICMR_THREADS_PER_CONN 2 DuckDB threads per connection. PORT 7860 (Gradio default) Port the server listens on – set by Render automatically.

🔧 Dependencies

· fastapi · gradio · duckdb · httpx · uvicorn · pydantic

📝 Limitations

· Remote-only mode – the app does not support local database; all indexes are downloaded via HTTP on first query. · Name search – only available in contains mode, and it may be slower (uses ILIKE on the phone index view). · OtherNumber – not indexed, so exact searches on it will return no results. · Rate limiting – not implemented in this version. · Data accuracy – the data is sourced from public datasets; the app only provides search capabilities and does not verify authenticity.
